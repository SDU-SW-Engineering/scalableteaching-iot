# Prerequisites
## Visual Studio Code
In order to work with ESP-IDF, you will need to have a working Visual Studio Code install. Refer to the following link if it is not already the case : https://code.visualstudio.com/download

A working Python3 install is required, as well as Pip.

## Clean system
You should only work through Vscode's ESP-IDF extension. Make sure that any previous ESP-IDF installs are removed to avoid conflicts. Do __not__ install ESP-IDF from the website manually, as this is far from being a foolproof process.

# Installing and using ESP-IDF

Follow the guides on the following link, starting with `install.md` : https://github.com/espressif/vscode-esp-idf-extension/blob/HEAD/docs/tutorial

Here you will find the ESP-IDF extension guides, including how to create template projects, use debugging functionalities, or how to configure your system if you are using WSL.

__It is strongly recommended that you check `basic_use.md` before getting started.__

You can also refer to the extension's page within Vscode to find useful links, functionalities wrap-up, and shortcuts descriptions.
